= Introduction
This report documents the work of this semester's project, a privacy-preserving OPD (Outpatient Department) management system. The project relies on skills gathered from this semester's subjects to provide a working solution for managing consultations in clinical environments, from booking to AI-assisted prescription.

The system consists of a web application that lets patients handle appointment booking and allows doctors to control the consultation workflow: audio recording, transcription, AI-generated summary and suggestions, and finally, delivery of the doctor's note via email.

Components are connected through well-defined interfaces, and the locally run AI model guarantees that no patient data ever leaves the clinic's network. The project showcases how a component-based design, a local LLM, and a containerized infrastructure can work together in a privacy-sensitive environment.
== Motivation
Outpatient departments spend the majority of their time on administrative work rather than focusing on patient care. Managing appointments on paper, taking notes during consultations, and writing prescriptions in separate tools all contribute to staff burnout. As a consequence, patients suffer from longer waits and less focused consultations.

AI-based tools can be used to ease this workload. However, the solution must not rely on cloud services. Since patient records are sensitive by nature, regulations require that they stay under the control of the facility that holds them.

This project addresses these problems by creating a system that automates the entire clinical workflow from appointment booking to digital prescription while everything is kept local.
== Objective
The project's aim is to deliver a working OPD management system that supports patients' and doctors' everyday workflows. The system's design lets patients easily book and manage appointments with the help of a simple interface, as well as providing doctors a way to record consultations, and easily create a prescription with the locally stored data without it ever leaving the clinic's infrastructure.

To achieve this, the project provides the following core capabilities:

*Appointment Management:*
Patients are able to register, log in, search for doctors, and create or cancel bookings.

*Audio Recording and Transcription:*
Doctors begin and conclude consultations from their portal. The system records the audio and passes it to a local speech-to-text service for transcription.

*Summary Generation:*
A locally hosted LLM, served through Ollama, processes the transcript and produces a structured consultation summary. The summary is then manually checked for accuracy before finalization.

*Prescription Review and Delivery*: Upon summary validation, a prescription is generated along with suggestions such as overlooked medications and/or referrals. Doctors can then revise the prescription if needed and finally export it as a PDF and send it to patients via email.



= Methodology
Before starting out on our project, we outlined a set of rules and methods which ensured that progression throughout the project will be smooth and continous.
The methodology and tools used also ensured that every contribution made to the project was peer-reviewed.

== Task tracking
In order to ensure that none of the tasks get lost, we made every task (programming, diagramming, documenting) an issue on Jira.
We completed these tasks during one-week-long Sprints, from one Monday to the next.
Some exceptions were made with the length of the Sprints, for example around the spring break.
On Mondays, we held meetings, where we both reflected on the Sprint ending that day, and planned the one coming up.
On Thursdays we also regularly held stand-up meetings, where everyone gave an update on their issue(s).

To ensure that tasks were distributed fairly, we assigned tasks not based on their sheer quantity, but based on the tasks' actual difficulty.
We agreed collectively on an issue's story point value, using Story Point Poker.

== Documents and Presentations
To create our documentation and presentations, we chose #link("https://typst.app/")[Typst].
As Typst is a text-based document markup language, this allowed us to version control and handle our documents as if they were code.
We also made templates to create a uniform look for all of our reports and presentations.
In order to keep track of our images and diagrams, we also decided to store them in the same repository as our documents and code.
We also created a meeting log document during each meeting to keep everyone accountable and to allow team members to catch up, in case they were absent.

== Repository
To make sure code contributions are safe, each issue had its own branch, and pull requests had to be opened.
Those pull requests had to be reviewed by at least two non-contributing.
In order to allow for a rigorous and in-depth review of each contributions, we made it a rule that pull requests must be opened by Fridays, which left us the entire weekend for review and refactoring.
To help the work of the reviewers and to guarantee a smooth workflow, a Pull Request Template has also been made, see @pr-template.
We merged all pull requests together during our Monday meetings, so we can resolve possible merge conflicts with all contributors input.
We also created a pipeline that sends a message to our Discord server about a new pull request, and by replying to that message, the PR owner tags the requested reviewers.

All in all, these methods and rules helped us improve our productivity by a lot, compared to previous semesters.
It also made the entire process, less of a hassle, and way more enjoyable.
Our team completed every task within the deadlines, with time to review and discuss different opinions.

= Problem analysis

== Background and Motivation

Outpatient departments face outdated manual processes that drastically slow down operations and put a burden on both patients and medical staff. Doctors and nurses spend too much time on paper schedules, taking notes during consultations, and using separate systems for writing prescriptions. This causes long wait times, a poor patient experience due to disrupted doctor focus, errors, and burnout from extra administrative work. These issues also create serious privacy risks for patient data, which demand strict precautions and careful handling.

Our project offers a solution for a clear gap: the need for simple AI tools that run entirely locally using open-source models, keeping all sensitive health information secure within the clinic's network. By automating the full process from patient booking and real-time transcription to AI-generated clinical summaries, "safety-net" suggestions, and instant digital prescriptions, it helps healthcare facilities modernize quickly and affordably. This reduces mistakes, speeds up patient flow, and relieves medical staff of the burden of endless paperwork, allowing them to focus on delivering quality care and improving patient satisfaction.

== Problem Statement

Danish General Practitioners (GPs) have contact with around 49 patients per day on average. Operating with such a high volume of patients carries risks of making mistakes across three core steps: diagnosis, prescribing, and referral.#footnote[

== Aim

The aim of this project is to provide a privacy-preserving, locally hosted OPD management system that automates the workflow from consultation to digital prescription, using open-source speech-to-text and large language models, with a "safety net" of suggestive alerts.

Managing such such a worklfow in a single, tightly coupled system would make it difficult to maintain, extend and replace individual parts. Therefore the technical aim of our project is to tackle this challenge through component-based architecture by implementing multiple independent services: appointment management, transcription, clinical summarisation, medical suggestions, and prescription generation. These services are isolated, each with its own runtime environment and well-defined interfaces that connect them and enable easy replacement and seamless upgrades of individual components.

The system follows a privacy-first design, as dealing with sensitive health data requires strict precautions. To achieve this, only locally hosted open-source models are used, so that patient data never leaves the hospital's network.

This modular design makes it easy to replace components while preserving privacy and supporting clinical workflow.

== Use cases

=== Booking process 
- *Primary actor:* Patient
- *Preconditions:* Patient is registered in the system and has valid login credentials
- *Goal:* Book a consultation with a doctor

*Flow* _(see @activity_login, @activity_bookings)_
+ The user navigates to the client website and logs in
+ The user selects a preferred doctor
+ The system displays available time slots
+ The user books an available appointment
+ The user is redirected to a dashboard where they can view or cancel their bookings
+ The system sends a confirmation email

=== Consultation process
- *Primary actor:* Doctor
- *Secondary actor:* Patient
- *Preconditions:* An appointment exists in the system and the doctor has valid credentials
- *Goal*
  - Doctor and patient discuss the issues
  - Doctor identifies symptoms, makes a diagnosis, and if necessary prescribes medicine and refers the patient to another department
  - The system internally processes the audio and transcribes the consultation

*Flow* _(see @activity_doctor)_
+ User navigates to the doctor website and logs in
+ The system displays a dashboard with the day's appointments
+ The user selects the appropriate appointment and starts consultation
+ The system begins audio recording
+ The system waits until the user ends the consultation
+ Audio recording is stopped and sent to the speech-to-text component for transcription

)

=== Review and send doctor's note to patient
- *Primary actor:* Doctor
- *Preconditions:* Consultation recording completed and successfully transcribed
- *Goal:* Review AI-generated documentation, validate clinical suggestions, and send the final doctor's note to the patient

*Flow* _(see @activity_doctor)_
+ The system generates a summary based on the transcription and displays it to the doctor
+ The doctor can either edit or accept the summary
+ When the summary is accepted, the system generates suggestions and a draft prescription
+ The doctor reviews, edits and approves the final prescription
+ The system exports the prescription as a PDF and emails it to the patient

== Risks

=== Security

The most significant risk in this project is the mishandling of sensitive patient data.
To avoid this, the system is split into two separate, locally hosted backends: a
booking service and a clinical workflow service. By keeping them separate, a request
to the booking backend only ever touches booking data, ensuring that confidential
medical information is never exposed through that path.

Structured booking data is stored in a relational database, while sensitive clinical
data (transcripts, summaries, and prescriptions) is stored in a separate
non-relational database.
The locally hosted LLM further reduces the risk of data breaches, as no data is sent
to external servers. Role-based access control and token-based authentication
prevent unauthorised access at the backend level.

=== Componentised Architecture

A tightly coupled system would make individual failures spread across the entire
application. By breaking the system into loosely coupled components with clearly
defined interfaces, failures are isolated to the affected component while the rest of
the system continues to function. This also simplifies debugging and makes
individual components independently replaceable without affecting others.

Docker containerisation is used to enforce isolation between services. Each
component runs in its own container, which also enables independent scaling and
automatic health checks. Containers that fail to respond can be automatically
restarted, reducing downtime and improving overall reliability.
